Registers
Common:
AR = ARH:ARL
BR = BRH:BRL
CR = CRH:CRL
DR = DRH:DRL
ER = ERH:ERL
FR = FRH:FRL
GR = GRH:GRL
Technic:
OA = OAH:OAL (Overflow Accomulator)
Index:
I0, I1, I2, I3, I4, I5, BE (Base), SK (Stack)
Segment:
.ZS (Zero Segment, Immutable)
.CS (Code Segment)
.DS (Data Segment)
.SS (Stack Segment)
.GS (Graphics Segment)
.S0, .S1, .S2, .S3, .S4, .S5, .S6, .S7, .S8, .S9, .SX
===========================-
- MOV Receiver, Source
Receiver may be: 8 and 16 bit register
Source may be: 8 and 16 bit register, value
Example: MOV AR, 0x76AA
	 MOV CR, AR
	 MOV CRH, ARL
============================
- ASG Receiver, Receiver, Source
Receiver may be: 8 and 16 bit register
Source may be: value only
Example: ASG AR, CR, 0x76AA
	 ASG BR, BR, 0x01A0
	 ASG BRL, BRH, 0xFF
============================
- MEM .Segement, Offset-Register, Source, Source
- MEM Receiver, Receiver, .Segement, Offset-Register (only 16 bit)
[.Segemt:Offset-Register] = Source|Source
Receiver(s) = [.Segemt:Offset-Register]
.Segemt may be only segment register
Offset-Register may be only 16-bit register
Source and Receiver may be both only 8 or 16 bit register
Example: MEM .DS, I0, ARL, ARH
	 MEM BR, CR, .DS, I0
	 MEM I0, SA, .SS, SA
============================
- ADD Receiver, Source
Receiver may be: 8 and 16 bit register
Source may be: 8 and 16 bit register, value
Result is plased to pair OA:Receiver
Example: ADD AR, 0xFFFE
	 ADD AR, CR
	 ADD CR, OA
	 ADD I0, CR
============================
- PLUS Receiver-1, Receiver-2, Source
Receiver may be: 8 and 16 bit register
Source: value only
Result is plased to pair OAH:Receiver-1, OAL:Receiver-2
Example: PLUS AR, AR, 2
	 PLUS AR, BR, 0x880A
	 PLUS I1, I0, 0xFF00
============================
- SUB Receiver, Source
Receiver may be: 8 and 16 bit register
Source may be: 8 and 16 bit register, value
Result is plased to Receiver
Example: SUB AR, 0xFFFE
	 SUB AR, CR
	 SUB CR, OA
	 SUB I0, CR
============================
- PLUS Receiver-1, Receiver-2, Source
Receiver may be: 8 and 16 bit register
Source: value only
Result is plased to pair Receiver-1, Receiver-2
Example: MINUS AR, AR, 2
	 MINUS AR, BR, 0x880A
	 MINUS I1, I0, 0xFF00
============================
- IFZ Register-1, Register-2
Registers may be only 8-bit
If Register-1 and Regsiter-2 both is equl 0, processor executes code until CEND instruction
- IFE Register-1, Register-2
Registers may be only 8-bit
If Register-1 and Regsiter-2 is equl, processor executes code until CEND instruction
- IFG Register-1, Register-2
Registers may be only 8-bit
If Register-1 is greater than Regsiter-2, processor executes code until CEND instruction
- IFL Register-1, Register-2
Registers may be only 8-bit
If Register-1 is lower Regsiter-2, processor executes code until CEND instruction
